      "Thought: The paper focuses on improving the efficiency of calculating the equation of state (EOS) for neutron matter, which is crucial for interpreting astrophysical observations, especially of neutron stars. It tackles the challenge that accurate many-body calculations (using methods like AFDMC) are too computationally intensive to perform repeatedly when propagating uncertainties from nuclear interactions through the EOS. The authors sidestep this issue by developing fast emulators based on parametric matrix models that mimic AFDMC outputs. These emulators can rapidly evaluate the EOS for a wide range of nuclear Hamiltonians, incorporate uncertainties (including those from EFT truncation), and thus provide robust error estimates that are essential for astrophysical data analysis.\n",

      "Thought: The paper provides constraints on the radius of a canonical 1.4 Mₒ neutron star. Specifically, with conservative assumptions the authors obtained R₁.₄ = 12.26₋₀.₉₁⁺₀.₈₀ km, and including all constraints yields R₁.₄ = 12.20₋₀.₄₈⁺₀.₅₀ km. These estimates are centered around 12 km. A radius of 22 km would be almost twice as large as these values and is therefore not consistent with the results presented in the paper.\n",
