# LANL Scientific Agent

Testing a centralized package for an agentic workflow. This should not be the final name, but I am pushing up this code that works. 

requirements.txt is the file that results from pip freeze on the environment I have working at the moment. 
It may have a few extra packages from testing and examples, but it should provide a working environment.

## How to use this code

Better documentation will be incoming, but for now there are examples in the examples folder that should give
a decent idea for how to set up some basic problems. They also should give some idea of how to pass results from
one agent to another. I will look to add things with multi-agent graphs, etc. in the future. 

If you have problems or questions, please use the gitlab Issues tab to submit things to be worked on.
