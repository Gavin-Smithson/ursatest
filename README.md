# LANL Scientific Agent

Test skeleton for an agentic workflow. This should not be the final name, but I am pushing up this code that works-ish. 

requirements.txt is the requirements file that was automatically generated when making the code base at the jam session.

requirements2.txt is the file that results from pip freeze on the environment I have working at the moment.
