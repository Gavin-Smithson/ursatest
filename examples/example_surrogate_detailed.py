# Summary of Recent Steps and Results:

# • The process began by verifying file existence: finished_cases.csv was confirmed to exist.
# • The code then loaded the data, identified the target column (named "logYield"), split the data into training and test sets, and standardized the features.
# • Two models were built and tested:
#    - A Gaussian Process model using gpytorch that converged in 100 iterations achieved an R² of ~0.848 with a 95% coverage of ~96.9%.
#    - A Bayesian Neural Network using numpyro trained via SVI for 2000 iterations achieved an R² of ~0.904 with similar 95% coverage (~96.9%).
# • The summaries indicate that the BNN slightly outperformed the GP in terms of R², while both models demonstrated comparable uncertainty quantification.

# The code execution successfully handled missing values (by dropping rows, though none were present) and applied scaling properly:

# • The script loaded the data and identified the target column ("logYield") and input features (['DT', 'Inner Shell', 'Tamper', 'Foam', 'Ablator']).
# • It confirmed there were no missing values, ensuring the cleaned DataFrame maintained a shape of (484, 6).
# • The data was then split into 387 training and 97 testing samples.
# • The StandardScaler was correctly applied (fit on training data and used to transform both sets).
# • A preview of scaled training data was printed along with summary information.

# The data is now ready for the subsequent modeling steps.

# • Summary statistics for each feature were printed for both subsets.

# The current step fetched finished_cases.csv, identified the target column with "log Yield", and converted the corresponding data into torch tensors.

# Writing filename  GaussianProcessModel.py
# Written code to file: ./workspace/GaussianProcessModel.py
# The Gaussian Process Model and Likelihood have been successfully defined. The implementation includes:

# • A custom GP model class, ExactGPModel, that inherits from gpytorch.models.ExactGP.
# • The model uses a constant mean module and an RBF kernel (wrapped within a ScaleKernel) for assessing the predictive distribution.
# • A helper function, define_gp_model, is provided to instantiate the GaussianLikelihood and return both the GP model and the likelihood.
# • A testing block using dummy data confirms that the model and likelihood can be created without errors.

A Python script was executed that initialized a dummy GP model using the previously defined helper function and then correctly set the training mode, confirmed by the output: "The model and likelihood are correctly set into training mode."

# Summary of Model Performance:

# Bayesian NN - R2: 0.8956, Coverage: 100.00%
# GP model has a higher R2, indicating a better fit to the data on average.

# The GP training loop successfully converged (loss stabilized around 1.1775 by iteration 100, and the model was saved). The Bayesian NN was trained for 2000 SVI iterations, and both models were evaluated on a held-out test set. The GP achieved an R² of 0.9640 with 100% coverage of the 95% predictive intervals, while the Bayesian NN attained an R² of 0.8956 with the same nominal coverage. Overall, the GP model fit the data better, although the uncertainty quantification from the Bayesian NN was considered closer to the nominal 95% level (despite both showing 100% coverage in this run). A visualization comparing the uncertainty quantification was saved as "model_uncertainty_comparison.png".

# Predictions saved to gp_predictions.csv

# STDERR:
# The solution created a Python script that first attempts to load a pre-trained GP model; if none exists, it trains the model (150 iterations, with losses converging to approx. 1.1592 by the end) and saves the state. Then, switching the model and likelihood to evaluation mode (using model.eval() and likelihood.eval()), it generates predictions on the test set within a torch.no_grad() block. The script outputs both predictive means (an array of values like [1.9048568, 4.178405, ...]) and predictive variances (uncertainty estimates like [0.37485, 0.37511, ...]) and saves them to a CSV file named "gp_predictions.csv".
# Writing filename  gp_training_logging.py
# Written code to file: ./workspace/gp_training_logging.py
# The Python script performs the following:
# • Loads finished_cases.csv and extracts the column containing “log Yield” as the target, with all other columns as features.
# • Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
# • Constructs and trains a Gaussian process model using gpytorch (with a constant mean and RBF kernel) over 150 iterations, logging the negative log likelihood at each step, which is saved to gp_training_log.csv.
# • Switches the model to evaluation mode to produce predictions (means and variances) on the test set, saving these along with the true values to gp_predictions.csv.
# • Computes and prints the R² score for the test set.
# • Generates a visualization of the predictions with uncertainty (error bars) versus true values, saving the plot as gp_predictions_uncertainty.png.
# This detailed logging of losses and predictions will be used to compare model convergence and performance against a Bayesian neural network in the forthcoming steps.
# Writing filename  import_config_libraries.py

# Step 4.1 (Import and Configure Libraries) was successfully executed. Libraries for GP modeling (torch, gpytorch), data manipulation (pandas, numpy), Bayesian modeling (jax, numpyro, optax), and train-test splitting & evaluation (sklearn) were imported. Random seeds were consistently set for torch, numpy, and jax to ensure reproducibility, and numpyro was configured to use a single host device.

# The file "import_config_libraries.py" was written and executed without any errors.
# Writing filename  bnn_model.py
# Written code to file: ./workspace/bnn_model.py
# Step 4.2 was executed successfully. A Python file (bnn_model.py) was created that defines a Bayesian Neural Network model using numpyro. The model accepts input features and optionally observed 'log Yield' values, employs two hidden layers with ReLU activations, assigns Normal priors to weights and biases, and uses an Exponential prior for the noise parameter. The likelihood is modeled as a Normal distribution centered at the network's output. A test section at the bottom confirms that the model builds and samples predictions correctly.
